This is an R script that simulates the classic pennydrop game. I started with a basic R script to simulate, but will us AI assisted tools to generate the rest.

Here is a description of the game rules, from Google Gemini (that I formatted):

## Get Ready to Drop! Understanding the Classic Penny Drop Game
The Penny Drop game is a simple yet engaging dice game of luck and strategy, perfect for players of all ages. The goal is straightforward: be the first player to get rid of all your pennies.

Here's a breakdown of the classic rules:

Objective: To be the first player to run out of pennies.

Players: Typically 2 to 6 players.

### Equipment:

**A "Penny Drop" game board:** This is a small box with a series of numbered slots (usually 1 through 5) on top, and a special slot or hole labeled "6".

**One standard six-sided die.**

**A set number of pennies** for each player (commonly 10 or 12, though this can be adjusted for shorter or longer games).

### Setup:

Each player starts with an equal number of pennies.
Determine the starting player. This is often done by each player rolling the die, with the highest roller going first. Play then typically proceeds clockwise.

### Gameplay:

1. Rolling the Die: On a player's turn, they roll the die.
2. Placing Pennies:
  * If the player rolls a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the corresponding slot on the game board is empty, they place one of their pennies into that numbered slot.
  * If the player rolls a 6, their penny "drops" into the box through the #6 slot and is out of play for the remainder of the game.
3. Occupied Slots:
  * If a player rolls a number (1-5) corresponding to a slot that already has a penny in it, they must take all the pennies currently on the game board (from all slots 1-5) and add them to their own supply. Their turn then ends.
4. Continuing or Ending Your Turn:
  * After successfully placing a penny in an empty slot (1-5) or dropping one in the #6 slot, the player can choose to either roll again or end their turn and pass the die to the next player.
  * A player must roll at least once on their turn.
  * A player can continue rolling as many times as they wish, as long as they are successfully placing pennies in empty slots or the #6 slot. However, the risk of rolling an occupied slot and taking all the pennies increases with each roll.

### Winning the Game:

The first player to successfully get rid of all their pennies (either by placing them in slots that are subsequently picked up by another player, or by dropping them into the #6 slot) is declared the winner.
